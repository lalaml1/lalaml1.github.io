# Lab 1 - Foundations of the Web

## Report 


## The lab's overview

- The goal of this assignment was to create and launch a professional portfolio website that showcases my project work, abilities, experiences, and academic background. In addition, this website illustrates fundamental ideas covered in the Web Application Programming and Hacking course, including web development, GitHub deployment, JavaScript interactivity, API integration, and cookie handling.

I picked up information about how to:

 Build a personal website with Bootstrap and HTML5/CSS3.

 Utilize APIs to incorporate real-time content and dynamic JavaScript features.

 Keep your layout responsive and your design up to date.

 Website in real time: https://lalaml1.github.io/index.html

## Task 2: Non-Technical Requirements 

## part 1

- I have used bootstrap 5 from CDN to design different kind of representative layout which looks good and it also designs the navigation bars, profile cards, buttons and grids.

- Basically it was inserted in the <head> block of the html code.

- I have Included this bootstrap https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css code in the head tag in every html code individually, so it runs the code good.

- And this made the website friendly and easy to navigate for everyone.

## part 2 : Page Tracker

- It shows the stats of the home page.

- I have used the url to integrate the flag counter is www.flagcounter.com

- We can customize different kinds of ways for the flag counter by defining the url bg_FFFFFF/txt_000000

## Task 3: Technical Requirements  

## part 1: Digital clock and Analog clock

- In this we are creating the digital clock and analog clock for the website in which I used the same code.

- It displays both analog and digital clock at one place.
